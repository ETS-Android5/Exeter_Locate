# Exeter Locate Application/Server
Exeter locate application and associated server are designed to facilitate the collection of Location (GPS), Wi-Fi/Bluetooth acess-points and their strength, aswell as accelerometer and magnetometer data, for research initially by University of Exeter Researchers.
